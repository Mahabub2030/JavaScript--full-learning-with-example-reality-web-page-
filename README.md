## 🔁 When to Use Boolean?

- Permission check (admin/user)	isAdmin, hasPermission
- Game state (paused, started)	isGameOver, isPlaying
- Email sent/received status	isEmailSent, hasUnreadMessages

## 🔍 Where and When Should You Use Booleans in This Game?
*What We Check	Boolean Example	Why*

- Is it a tie?	userChoice === computerChoice	To stop the game as a draw
- Did the user win?	Complex Boolean logic combining multiple conditions	To decide the - - - winner
- Control game logic	Using if, else if, else	To trigger different game outcomes

## 💡 Real-World Scenario for Boolean Usage in Games:

- Any game logic that needs win/lose/draw decision.
- In a quiz app, check if the answer is correct.
- In a login system, check if credentials are valid.
- In multiplayer games, track game status: isGameOver, isPlayerTurn, isOnline, etc.

## ⚙️ What is a Function in JavaScript?
*A function is a block of code that runs only when you call it. It helps you:*

- Reuse code
- Organize logic
- Make your code clean and readable

✅ *Why and When Should You Use Functions?*
- Situation	Why Use a Function?
- Repeating tasks	Avoid writing the same code again & again
- Splitting code into pieces	Easier to read and manage
- Handling inputs & outputs	Great for calculations, logic, conditions
- Making decisions (game, UI, etc)	Keep logic clea

# 🔥Real-Life Examples
📦 1. Calculate Total Price in Shopping Cart
🔐 2. Login Validator
🧠 3. Check Even or Odd Number
🎮 4. Game: Is Winner
⏱ 5. Show Welcome Message Based on Time

🔧 Best Practices
✅ Use descriptive names
✅ Use parameters for flexible logic
✅ Use return to get values back
